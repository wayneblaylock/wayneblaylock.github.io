<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<img src="media/graduating.jpg" alt="me in a graduation gown" height="350px" width="auto">
<p>I grew up in Spanish Fork Utah, in an incredible family. I am the 7th child of 8 kids! Growing up I was always really interested in two things, engineering, and entrepreneurship, and was always working on a project of some kind.</p>
<p>In high school I went to Spanish Fork High, and had a great time there. I took all the engineering and business classes I could, and spent many of my class periods at the ALC. The ALC is a special high school in my district where you can take classes not regularly offered at highshcools like robotics and entrepreneurship. Aside from academics, I was on the Cross Country and Track team of my high school.</p>
<p>I graduated from High School in the Class of 2020, and spent the following summer working on a landscaping business that I had started with a friend called <a href="https://busybeeoddjobs.com/" target="_blank">Busy Bee Odd Jobs</a>. That went on untill I decided to sign up to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
</div>
<div id="mission">
<h3>Mission</h3>
<img src="media/leaving_on_a_mission.jpg" alt="me leaving on my mission" height="350px" width="auto">
<p>After submitting my mission papers, it wasn't too long before I had my mission call. I was called to serve in the Miniapolis Minnesota Mission, and left on September 23, 2020.</p>
<p>In my church, a mission is an opportunity to spend time serving others, and finding ways to share the gospel of Jesus Christ, wich we believe can bring peace in any circumstances. When I started my mission, the world was still trying to decide how to respond the Covid 19, and this restricted our activities as missionaries. Most of my mission was spent indoors not being able to directly searve others, but we found creative ways to do good online. All missionaries at this time spent hours a day on social media, creating uplifting content. I created a Facebook page called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/433158801028019/about/" target="_blank">Star Wars Gospel Analogies</a>, wich currently has nearly four thousand members!</p>
<p>Durring all that time indoors, I also took the opportunity to learn some new technical skills. As we were creating lots of content, I learned video editing with an open source software called olive. Next I learned photo editing and vector graphic design with GIMP and Inkscape(also open source softwares). Next, I finally learned to code. I started playing with Python, and used it to automate taks and make my computer work easier. From there I picked up HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
<p>My mission, though different than most, was an incredible expeirience where I learned alot. It made me better at communication, more confident, and lead to the technical skills that I've mentiond.</p>
